the importance of testing in nodeJS applications

you do not need to test the components of the system that you did not write. assume that the

@packages to install
@types/supertest -D(install as dev dependencies)

we can test end to end from the route to the mongoDB, or you can test a single component like the middleware
alone or anything else
